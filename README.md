About the Game
Tetris is a puzzle game where players rotate and move falling blocks called "Tetrominoes" to create horizontal lines without any gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears, and points are awarded. As the game progresses, the speed increases, making it harder to place the Tetrominoes.

How to Play
1.Start the Game: Run the main game file as described above.
2.Controls:
  Arrow Up: Rotate the Tetromino
  Arrow Left/Right: Move the Tetromino left or right
  Arrow Down: Increase the drop speed temporarily
3.Game Over: The game ends when the Tetrominoes stack up to the top of the screen.

Scoring
1.Clearing multiple lines in one drop earns higher scores.
2.The game speeds up after certain score thresholds, making it progressively challenging.
